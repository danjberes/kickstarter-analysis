# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to draw correlations in the data between success or failure of kickstarter campaigns based on data such as goals, launch date, country.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This analysis was performed using pivot table in Microsoft Excel to compare the outcomes (successful, failed, and cancelled) to the month of the year that the kickstarter campaign launched. The spreadsheet and graph can be found in the repository at: https://github.com/danjberes/kickstarter-analysis 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel comparing completed or cancelled kickstarter campaigns against their anticipated goals. The spreadsheet and graphs can be found in the repository at: https://github.com/danjberes/kickstarter-analysis
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Potential difficulties in this analysis could come from improper coding in the COUNTIFS function (such as not using quotation marks when using dollar amounts as criteria). 
## Results

#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theater based kickstarter campaigns that launch in May have the highest number of successful campaigns. However, May is also the month with the most amount of theater campaigns launched. May also has the highest amount of theater campaigns failed when launched during that month. The lowest ratio of successful:failed theater campaigns occurs in December with a 37:35 ratio. December also has the smallest amount of theater campaigns launched, so it is unlikely to be statistically significant. Cancelled theater campaigns are pretty low and consistent throughout the year with the exception of October which has had no cancelled campaigns. The late spring and early summer months appear to have the highest ratio of successful:failed campaigns. While there is some correlation in data based on launch date of the campaign, no causation can likely be drawn from this data. 
#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Kickstarter campaigns that have lower financial goals tend to have a higher success rate than those with higher financial goals. Above a 25,000 USD goal this trend varies slightly but this could be due to the lower sample size of campaigns exceeding 30,000 USD goals. The amount of cancelled campaigns also increases as fundraising goals increase. This may be due to the realization that costs may be higher than expected or that the goal is unfeasible. 
#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset does not account for age groups targeted (younger audiences may not have as much disposable income to help support these campaigns), nor does it account for marketing or external visits to the kickstarter page.
#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Percentage funded vs. if a project received kickstarter spotlight to see if that can potentially help campaigns succeed. Another most likely less useful comparison that could be made is number of backers vs. average donation and see if campaigns that have more backers (likely leading to lower average donations) are more or less likely to bee successful than those campaigns that have less backers.
